# password-checker-Java-GUI
Program that allows student to check their grades if correct password and username is entered.

This is a program where I have created a class "Students" and made 5 random student objects with their grades as private variable. 
There is also a GUI that allows the user to enter his/her user name and password. 
User name is checked with the student list and password is checked with a format of L-L-L-N-N-N-N where L stands for letter and N stands for number. 

If the user enters correct information: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86128944/128406191-839f55a9-b008-4469-aab9-caff58e5eedc.png)

If the user enters incorrect information: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86128944/128406292-0fc91e43-138c-4704-baff-6fd0bf53911c.png)

No SQL databases are used. 
I have learned basic Java GUI and implemented this throught this project earlier and uploaded this as a repository as of 6th August.
